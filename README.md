I developed two solutions:
 - File SolutionIntegersWithUniqueOccurrence.java solves the problem as per the original conditions of the HackerRank challenge, where only unique integers are allowed as an input.
- File SolutionIntegersWithMultipleOccurrences.java solves the problem with an additional condition that allows the same integer to occur more than once as an input. Apart from that, all other conditions remain the same as per the original HackerRank challenge.

In both cases each element of an array could be used only once to form a pair in accordance to the target value. This means that in the case of multiple integers, when there is an array {1, 1, 1, 2, 2} and a target value of 1, only two pairs of (1,2) can be formed.
